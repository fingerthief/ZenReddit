## ✨ Features

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Navigation
*   **All Popular**: The default view. Shows trending content from Reddit, filtered for positivity.
*   **Home**: Shows content from your followed subreddits.
*   **Sidebar**: Search for subreddits (e.g., "CozyPlaces", "Woodworking") and click the `+` to follow them.

### Adjusting AI Settings
1.  Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right corner.
2.  **Filter Strictness**: Use the slider to determine how aggressive the filtering is.
    *   *< 30*: Relaxed (Allows mild controversy).
    *   *50*: Balanced (Standard filtering).
    *   *> 70*: Strict (Wholesome content only).
3.  **OpenRouter Config**: Enter your API Key and select your preferred model.

### Video Support
Video posts are automatically detected.
*   **Thumbnails**: Video posts display a "Play" icon overlay on the thumbnail.
*   **Playback**: Click a post to open the Detail View, where the video will be embedded (using Reddit's secure media fallback).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

*   **"Rate limited by Reddit"**: Reddit has strict API limits for unauthenticated requests. If you refresh too often, wait a minute and try again.
*   **Images/Videos not loading**: The app uses a CORS proxy (`corsproxy.io`) to fetch data from Reddit, as Reddit does not support client-side CORS natively. If the proxy is down, content may fail to load.
*   **AI Analysis Stuck**: If the "Analyzing..." visualizer runs forever, check that your OpenRouter Key is valid and has credits.
